I’m designing a momentum-based, bouncy platformer where the player can perform tricks (like spins, flips, grabs, or stunts) in midair. Tricks currently only increase speed, but I want them to be valuable even when the player has reached a set speed cap. The game should reward skillful, stylish, or risky tricks without making them mandatory for basic progression.

Please brainstorm creative, varied incentives for performing tricks beyond just speed boosts. These incentives can affect gameplay, scoring, style systems, environment interaction, or player abilities. Include both short-term and long-term rewards. Try to balance mechanical benefits (e.g., unlocking temporary abilities) and cosmetic/score-based rewards (e.g., crowd reactions, style points). Aim for at least 10–15 unique ideas that would make tricks satisfying and strategically worthwhile while still keeping the game accessible.
